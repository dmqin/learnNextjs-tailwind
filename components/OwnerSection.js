                            I have been learning about how to make website since the beginning of 2021 and I learn this because I have an interest in technology. But, I only code in my leisure time. </p>
                            <p className="text-lg mt-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                            Actually, this is my own project, not for work or study, just for fun. 
                            I made this website use javascript language with Next Js library and Tailwind CSS framework. 
                            I want to add more features in this website but, I do not think I have time to finish it soon 
                            because I am in twelvth grade and a lot of examination coming.
                            Last but not the least, I wanna say thank you to everyone who already read until here and I hope u guys enjoy this website. 
                            That's all I can say and stay tuned... :)
